#   First Problem
A guy called Joe wants to implement one behavior in his game (a duck simulator), that is, the ducks should fly.
But then, he realized that neither all the ducks should fly, but when he realized such a thing, it was already committed to production.
Now, he wants to solve the problem, and for that he proposed one solution that is:

    "What if I create an abstract class called Flyable?"

But the problem of it is that you would have to make every duck that you create fly.
And what if you just wanted to change the behavior a little bit? You would need to change 60 ducks classes?

So, this script is all about me taking this problem, and implementing a solution that I think is right.
I didn't see the solution of the book, so when I do, I'll commit it together, so that you (and me) can compare the two solutions at anytime.
