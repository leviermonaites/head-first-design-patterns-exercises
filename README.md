# Head First Design Pattern Exercises
Exercises from the book Head First Design Patterns

Each folder is a different pattern that I came across.
Each folder will contain two or three folders called Exercises, another one called Problems, and a possible extra one called OfMyOwn see below, what each of them mean.


**Exercises:**
  - Exercises from the book, like a teacher would assign for a student.

**Problems**
  - Problems used as examples that I like to follow along trying to implement a solution.

**OfMyOwn**
  - When I think I understood the concept at first, I try to implement it on my own.
